# Auth3 Identity Platform Examples

These repository contains several examples to integrate with the [Auth3 Identity Platform](https://auth3.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=integration-examples).

In this repository we use [go](https://golang.dev) but the same can be achieved with any other supported language through [our SDKs](#get-sdk).

## Run examples

All of the proposed go examples, can be easily run specifying the following ENV parameters (as required by the example you wish to run):

* `AUTH3_CLIENT_ID` (always needed): your Auth3 client identifier
* `AUTH3_PROJECT_ID` (always needed): your Auth3 Project Identifier
* `AUTH3_CLIENT_SECRET` (only required by back-end controlled flows): secret for your Auth3 client ID.

You can easily test them out:

* register for an account on the [Auth3 Developer Console](https://console.auth3.dev?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=integration-examples) or follow [instructions](https://docs.auth3.dev/get-started/create-developer-account?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=integration-examples) for more info
* [create your demo project](https://docs.auth3.dev/get-started/create-a-project?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=integration-examples): this will be free thanks to the [initial credits](https://auth3.dev/pricing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=integration-examples)
* create a client and take note of the credentials: follow instructions for each flow [here](https://docs.auth3.dev/products/identity-platform/main?utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=integration-examples) to learn more or read nested README.md for more specific context.
